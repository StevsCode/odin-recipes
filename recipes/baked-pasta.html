        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour a generous amount of oil into a large saucepan and pan-fry the chopped onion. Once it's golden and slightly softened, add the crumbled sausage and cook it until browned.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, add the tomato puree, stir and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Bring salted water to a boil in a pot, then cook the rigatoni for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta, still al dente, and add it directly to the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add half of the grated cheese and bechamel and mix everything well.</li>
            <li>Layer the pasta in a baking dish, adding cubes of mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Add more bechamel and grated cheese, then layer the pasta again.</li>
            <li>Continue layering with mozzarella, bechamel, and cheese until all ingredients are used. Bake in a preheated static oven at 200 Celsius degrees for 20 minutes. Then, set the grill function for 5 more minutes for a crispy crust.</li>
            <li>The baked pasta is ready, gooey and delicious.</li>
            <li>Serve the pasta on individual plates, top with more grated Parmesan and enjoy!</li>
