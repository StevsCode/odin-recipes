This current project serves the purpose of showing how I got started with programming and web developing.
It is my first milestone in The Odin Project curriculum, focusing on building a simple recipe webpage.
By building this, I demonstrated that I'm able to create a structured HTML document, including a homepage and links to individual recipe pages.
I now have foundational skills in HTML like using semantic elements, creating links, organizing content with proper structure and ensuring readability.
This project also sets the groundwork for future projects and solidifies basic coding principles.
